    "intro": "The remote work revolution has untethered millions from their office zip codes, and Austin has emerged as one of the top destinations for this new workforce. The reasoning is compelling: no state income tax (keeping more of your remote salary), exceptional quality of life, a thriving creative and social scene, reliable infrastructure, and a cost of living that—while growing—still beats the coastal cities many remote workers are fleeing. Austin rewards the freedom of remote work with a life worth living.",

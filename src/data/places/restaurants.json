Aaron Franklin's obsessive attention to post oak smoke, premium beef, and perfect timing produces brisket that has won every major barbecue award in existence. The line starts forming before dawn, and waiting 3-4 hours is standard. But when you bite into that perfectly rendered, smoke-kissed brisket with its jet-black bark, you understand why people fly across the country for this experience. The pulled pork, sausage, and ribs are exceptional too.",
